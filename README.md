Below is the tutorial to run the project:

1. In the repository, go to the *Code* dropdown menu and download the Zip file.
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Open the folder in VS code (make sure to open the folder present *inside* the unzipped folder, it would have the same name as the original downloaded folder)
4. Then, once the files are reflecting in VS code, open the terminal (power shell) and write the command (python manage.py runserver)
5. It would run and generate the link to my CRUD project, access the link and test the project.
6. If any confusion in running it, please contact me @ Hassan.Qureshi01@student.csulb.edu.
